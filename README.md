This function will prepare a List of unique Stocks ( ticket)  in alphabetical order and corresponding opening , closing  value ( in each day) , Yearly chnage , percentage chnage and Total stock voulmes and populate those in I to N column. 
First Loop is built for that calculation 
2nd loop is for conditional formatting of Ticker Name ( Red and Green) based on percentage change. 
3rd loop is for calculating another summary - greatest percent increase , greatest percent decrease , and greatest total voulme among all stocks. 3 rd loop is not absolutely necessary - we can include that in 2 nd loop. But for the better clarification - I had built that loop.
Missed the Percentage formatting for last summary result. Update code for that.
Ran the VB Script in Multiple_Year_Stock_Data. Output Excel is present in Git repository
Prerequisite : This Excel should be in alphabetical order.
